# Hey there!
#
# Please use the following guidelines to format all your commit messages:
# 
#     <type>:(refs <scope>) <subject>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <body>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <footer>
# 
# Please note that:
#   - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that contains a 
#     succinct description of the change. It contains a type, an optional 
#     scope and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is providing. 
#         Allowed types are:
#             * feat      - (feature)
#             * fix       - (bug fix)
#             * docs      - (documentation)
#             * style     - (formatting, missing semi colons, …)
#             * refactor  - (refactor)
#             * test      - (when adding missing tests)
#             * chore     - (maintain)
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying place of the commit change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in the 
#         following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” / “changes”
#             * no capitalized first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#   - The BODY should include the motivation for the change and contrast 
#     this with previous behavior, and must be phrased in imperative present 
#     tense 
#   - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is 
#     also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit closes
# 
# Thank you
